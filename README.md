# Birthday_chance-paradox

# While learning python programming, I came across 
# the so-called birthday paradox, which is that in 
# a group of 23 people, the chance that at least 
# 2 people have birthdays on the same day is 50%. 
# I built a simple application that checked this. 
# It was confirmed and, curious about the problem, 
# I expanded the app to look for the chances of 
# at least 3 and 4 people having birthdays on 
# the same day. This is how the above application 
# was created.
